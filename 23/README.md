# What I learned from this year:

## Algorithms

[10.2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill

Fill a region of connected points.

[17] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm

Pathfinding algorithm.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm

Extended version of Dijkstra's algorithm with a heuristic function to guide the search.

## Optimization

[12.2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming

A cache useful with recursion.

Store and retrieve items in a custom order (e.g. lowest value first).

## Geometry

[18.2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick%27s_theorem: Area = Interior points + Boundary points / 2 - 1

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula: Area from list of points
